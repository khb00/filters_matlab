# filters_matlab

This repository was completed as a fourth year university project. The two example images used were provided by the University of Bath. The aim of this project was to make a range of different image filters to improve the quality of an image. The filter's written are:

- Mean filter ( less efficient and more efficient algorithm)
- Median filter (less efficient and more efficient and unfinished algorithm's)
- Adapted weighted median filter
- Gaussian filter
- Sharpening filter

An edge detector is included too.

To edit this code, do so in matlab.
